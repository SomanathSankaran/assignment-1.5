 QN 2.Difference between Data and Big data.
 
 A.STRUCTURE OF DATA

Traditional Data is Typically "STRUCTURED DATA" stored in databases or spreadsheets, required to be managed in accordance with a standardised storage format and ontology e.g. names, place names.
  
  Big Data is "UNSTRUCTURED DATA usually in the form of Text, audio, imagery, video, E.g. student email, chat rooms, questionnaire responses, lecture videos (audio & video)
  
 B.VOLUME OF DATA

The traditional system database can store only small amount of data ranging from gigabytes to terabytes. 

Big data helps to store and process large amount of data which consists of hundreds of terabytes of data or petabytes of data and beyond. 

C.DATA RELATIONSHIP

In the traditional database system relationship between the data items can be explored easily as the number of informations stored is small. 

Big data contains massive or voluminous data which increase the level of difficulty in figuring out the relationship between the data items

D.SCALING

Scaling is not preferred in traditional Data

Scaling is needed as big data deals with large volume of data.
 
 E.ACCURACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

Under the traditional database system it is very expensive to store massive amount of data, so all the data cannot be stored. This would decrease the amount of data to be analyzed which will decrease the resultâ€™s accuracy and confidence. 

While in big data as the amount required to store voluminous data is lower. Therefore the data is stored in big data systems and the points of correlation are identified which would provide high accurate results.

F.Higher cost of traditional data

Traditional database system requires complex and expensive hardware and software in order to manage large amount of data.  Also moving the data from one system to another requires more number of hardware and software resources which increases the cost significantly. 

While in case of big data as the massive amount of data is segregated between various systems, the amount of data decreases. So use of big data is quite simple, makes use of commodity hardware and open source software to process the data
